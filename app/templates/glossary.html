                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">Shows how much you're paying for each dollar of the company's profit. If a stock has a P/E of 20, you're paying $20 for every $1 the company earns annually.</p>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">Compares the stock price to the company's "book value" (assets minus liabilities). A P/B under 1 means you could theoretically buy the company for less than its assets are worth.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-white">PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth)</h3>
                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">Adjusts the P/E ratio for the company's growth rate. A high P/E might be justified if the company is growing fast. PEG under 1 suggests you're getting growth at a discount.</p>
                    <div class="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-2">
                        <span class="px-2 py-1 bg-green-900/50 text-green-400 rounded text-xs">&lt;1: Growth at a discount</span>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">The highest price the stock has ever reached. "% off ATH" shows how far the current price is below that peak. A stock 40% off ATH is trading at 60% of its highest price.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 Being far off ATH can signal a value opportunity—or a company in decline. Context matters!</p>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">Shows how much debt the company has relative to shareholder equity. A ratio of 0.5 means for every $1 shareholders have invested, the company owes $0.50 in debt.</p>
                    <div class="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-2">

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">The actual cash a company generates after paying all its operating expenses and capital investments. This is the real money available for dividends, buybacks, or growth.</p>
                    <div class="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-2">

                    </div>
                    <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 FCF is harder to manipulate than earnings, making it a more reliable indicator.</p>

                <div class="p-6">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-white">Profit Margin</h3>
                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">The percentage of revenue that becomes profit. A 20% profit margin means the company keeps $0.20 from every dollar of sales after all expenses.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 Compare margins within the same industry—tech companies typically have higher margins than retailers.</p>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">Measures how fast and how much a stock's price has changed recently, on a scale of 0-100. It helps identify if a stock might be overbought (due for a pullback) or oversold (due for a bounce).</p>
                    <div class="mt-3 flex flex-wrap gap-2">
                        <span class="px-2 py-1 bg-green-900/50 text-green-400 rounded text-xs">&lt;30: Oversold (potential buy signal)</span>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">Measures how volatile a stock is compared to the overall market. A beta of 1 means it moves with the market. Higher beta = bigger swings, both up and down.</p>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">The lowest and highest prices the stock has traded at over the past year. Seeing where the current price sits in this range gives context for whether it's near recent highs or lows.</p>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">The percentage of shares that have been "sold short"—borrowed and sold by investors betting the price will fall. High short interest means many people expect the stock to drop.</p>

                        <span class="px-2 py-1 bg-green-900/50 text-green-400 rounded text-xs">&lt;5%: Low (few betting against)</span>

                    <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 Very high short interest can lead to a "short squeeze" if the stock rises and shorts are forced to buy to cover losses.</p>

                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-white">Institutional Ownership</h3>
                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">The percentage of shares owned by big investors like mutual funds, pension funds, and hedge funds. High institutional ownership means professional investors believe in the company.</p>

                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">When company executives buy or sell their own stock. Insider buying is often bullish—they know the company best and are putting their own money on the line.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 Insider selling is less meaningful—executives might sell for personal reasons (taxes, diversification). But insider buying is almost always intentional.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="p-6">
                    <h3 class="font-semibold text-white">Reddit Sentiment</h3>
                    <p class="text-dark-300 mt-2">We analyze posts on r/stocks and r/wallstreetbets to gauge community sentiment. "Bullish" means more positive discussion, "Bearish" means negative, and "Mixed" is neutral.</p>
                    <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 Reddit sentiment can be a leading indicator but can also signal crowded trades. Use it as one data point among many.</p>

                <p class="text-dark-500 text-sm mt-2">💡 Very high yields can be a trap—if a stock drops 50%, its yield doubles, but that reflects distress, not generosity.</p>
